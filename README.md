# Final_Project

This was a dashboard I created for my final project in MA705, Data Sceicne. 

This dashboard allows the user to set a handful of parameters to determine what IPA suits their needs best. The user will input what type of IPA they want, the maximum alcohol percentage and the minimum average rating. In return, the dashboard will generate a list of IPAs that fall into the users parameters as well as a graph of what percentage of IPAs come from certain brewing companies. 

All of this information was taken from www.beeradvocate.com and you can click on the link below to go directly to their website.
